## Send and Receive emojis using Pidgin

This repository is a fork from unicode-emoji, and aims to complete a fully functional
emoji pack for using between Pidgin clients and mobile devices (specially
those using WhatsApp). It has the same icons as the Apple pack from the original repo,
but adds new remapping to receive icons properly (in addition to the ability to send them).


These Smilies can easily be used in Pidgin by copying the folders to ~/.purple/smileys
